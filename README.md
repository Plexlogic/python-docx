# python-docx

Promotion Wizard (AU and UK) used to import the Alliance repo https://github.com/AllianceSoftware/python-docx, which was a fork of an early version of https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx with some customisations. Depending on Alliance's public repos was deemed unacceptable, so our Promotion Wizard repos have been updated to depend on Plexus' repos instead (i.e., *this* one).

This repo is a fork of https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx with (at time of writing) the following additions:
1. The customisations from https://github.com/AllianceSoftware/python-docx, applied on top of [python-openxml@0.8.5](https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx/releases/tag/v0.8.5), released in this repo as [v0.8.5](https://github.com/Plexlogic/python-docx/releases/tag/v0.8.5)
1. The latest updates from [python-openxml@0.8.11](https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx/releases/tag/v0.8.11), released in this repo as [v0.8.5](https://github.com/Plexlogic/python-docx/releases/tag/v0.8.11)
